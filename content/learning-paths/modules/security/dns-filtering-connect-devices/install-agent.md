The Cloudflare One Agent allows you to protect corporate devices by securely and privately sending traffic from those devices to Cloudflareâ€™s global network, where Cloudflare Gateway can apply advanced web filtering.

Choose this option if:

- You want to create DNS policies based on user identity.
- You want to apply consistent policies for both remote and on-site users.
- You are interested in progressing from DNS-only security to the advanced protection offered by a Secure Web Gateway.

## Deploy the agent on a test device

Most admins test by downloading the client and authenticating in with a [one-time PIN](/cloudflare-one/identity/one-time-pin/).

1. Enable one-time PIN authentication:
    {{<render file="_one-time-pin.md" productFolder="cloudflare-one">}}
2. Enable device enrollment:

    {{<render file="_device-enrollment.md" productFolder="cloudflare-one">}}

3. Switch the agent to DNS-only mode:
    1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.
    2. In the **Device settings** card, select the **Default** profile.
    3. Select **Configure**.
    4. For **Service mode**, select **Gateway with DoH**.
    5. Select **Save profile**.

4. If you are running third-party firewall or TLS decryption software, verify that it does not inspect or block traffic to these IP addresses:
    - Client orchestration IPs:
        {{<render file="_client-orchestration-ips.md" productFolder="cloudflare-one">}}
    - Gateway DoH IPs:
        {{<render file="_doh-ips.md" productFolder="cloudflare-one">}}
For more information, refer to [WARP with firewall](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/firewall/).
5. [Download](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/) and install the agent on the device.
6. Once the agent is installed, manually authenticate into your Zero Trust organization:

<summary>iOS, Android, and ChromeOS</summary>

The agent will now forward all DNS queries from the device to Cloudflare Gateway for filtering.
